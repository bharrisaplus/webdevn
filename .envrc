# Update tips:
# 	* The raw version should be updated based on current time and also the previous value (see above)
# 	* All sanitized versions should
# 		* start at 0.0.0 before initial release
# 		* start at 0.0.1 for initial release and increment on each release
#			* release 10 would be 0.1.0 and release 100 would be 1.0.0
